# Bikesharing
# Overview of the Project.
- The purpose of this project was to use tableau to create data visualizations to demonstrate the culture of bike riding in New York City. This was done to provide a portofolio for investors in Des Moines. 

## Results 
- Using tableau, we helped create visualizations to provide investors a clear picture of NYC citibike riders.

 **Duration of Checkout Time.**

- The graph above shows the average time, which is about 5-6 minutes, a bike is checkout out by all users.

**Duration of Checkout Time per Gender.**

![per gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85714314/136152286-4f506d2b-68bd-474a-b17b-9d7180170695.png)

- This graph represents the average checkout time per gender. However, since males make for most of the riders, it would explain why they have the largest number of bikes per checkout time.

**Trips by Weekday per Hour.**

**User Types by Gender per Weekday.**
- The heatmap demonstrates that subscribers to a bike rental subscription are more likely to ride than customers who ride every once in a while. The heatmap also shows the differences between genders as well usage per day of the week.

![Per the years](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85714314/136154997-c1b8a34d-5a09-4f32-b478-d29b89fcfe28.png)
 
 - As shown above, the trip durations have increased gradually, this would be good for investors to know since the bikes are getting longer usage.

**Top Starting Locations**
